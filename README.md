## ⚡ What is ExeScan?

ExeScan is a lightweight Python-based static analyzer built for **security learners, researchers and developers**.

It inspects Windows executable files (`.exe`) **without running them** and extracts critical intelligence to help you decide if a file is safe, suspicious, or malicious.

Built in Termux. Tested on Android. Made to be fast, clean and deadly accurate.

## 🔥 Key Features

- **📁 PE Header Analysis** - Architecture, Machine Type, Entry Point, Sections
- **🔍 String Extraction** - URLs, IPs, File Paths, Registry Keys, Suspicious APIs
- **⚠️ Threat Heuristics** - Detection of packed / obfuscated / suspicious patterns
- **📊 Clean Report** - Colored terminal output, readable in seconds
- **🚀 Zero Dependencies** - Pure Python, works on Termux, Linux & Windows
- **🔒 100% Static** - The file is NEVER executed. Safe by design.

## 📦 Installation

bash
git clone https://github.com/SilentGhostExe1/exescan.git
cd exescan
python3 exescan_v2.3.py


No install. No setup. Just clone and run.

## 🎯 Usage

bash
Scan a file
python3 exescan_v2.3.py /path/to/file.exe

Example
python3 exescan_v2.3.py sample.exe


ExeScan will output:
1. File info & Hashes
2. PE Structure
3. Suspicious Strings
4. Final Verdict: `CLEAN / SUSPICIOUS / HIGH RISK`

## 🧠 Why ExeScan?

> Most people double-click an .exe without knowing what's inside.
> Hackers don't. Hackers scan first.

ExeScan was built with one mindset: **Know your target before you trust it.**
